EventHub is a Ruby on Rails application for managing events, registrations, and reviews. Users can browse events across different categories, register to attend them, and leave reviews once events are finished.

---

## Requirements

- Ruby 3.x
- Rails 8.1
- PostgreSQL
- Node.js & Yarn

---

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd EventHub2
```

### 2. Install Ruby dependencies

```bash
bundle install
```

### 3. Install JavaScript dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

### 4. Configure the database

Make sure PostgreSQL is running on your machine. Then create and migrate the database:

```bash
rails db:create
rails db:migrate
```

### 5. Seed the database

Populate the database with sample data:

```bash
rails db:seed
```

This will create:
- 5 users
- 6 events (in `draft`, `published`, and `finished` states)
- 5 categories
- 13 registrations (in `pending`, `confirmed`, and `cancelled` states)
- 4 reviews (only on finished events)

### 6. Run the application

```bash
rails server
```

Then open your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Data Model

The relational diagram is included in the repository as `EventHub_Data_Model.png`.

Main entities and their relationships:

- **User** — organizes events and can register to or review others
- **Event** — belongs to a user (organizer), has many registrations, reviews, and categories
- **Category** — associated to events through the `EventCategory` join table
- **Registration** — links a user to an event; has status (`pending`, `confirmed`, `cancelled`)
- **Review** — written by a user for a finished event; includes a rating (1–5) and a comment
